ePortfolio Assignment Details
Your ePortfolio should:

    -Demonstrate your professional competencies and identity, and 
    -Showcase the role of your experiences at ODU in preparing you for your next steps.

You may build your ePortfolio on any web-building platform. Suggestions include Canva, Wix, or WordPress.  Wix is a relatively easy to use web-builder that ODU supports and recommends. You can design the structure (pages, order, navigation, etc.) and appearance (color scheme, font choice, etc.) of your ePortfolio in the way you think best represents who you are as a professional. However, the following content must be included:

    -Introduction with brief biographical information and professional focus
    -Professional goals upon graduation
    -Explanation of your chosen program of study at ODU
    -Reflection on your experiences within the program and courses
    -Work samples from related work and hands-on activities.

Home
    This page sets the tone of your portfolio and establishes the narrative. Consider including an image that is reflective of who you are as a professional if you are comfortable doing so. You might also consider providing a quick, personal description here, similar to a slogan or motto, that signals your unique professional skills or interest/personal value statement (ex: Creating simulations of sea-rise issues to help the community prepare for the future). 

    Include a detailed passage describing your personal and professional goals. Share basic information like your major, class standing/anticipated graduation semester, and where you are from originally. You can use this space to share your interests and influences. Tell your visitors the story of how you became interested in your chosen field and the motivation behind your work. Why are you interested in pursuing a career in this field?   If known, share what your specific career goals are.  What would you like to accomplish upon graduation?  
    
    What do you aspire to accomplish in your career?

Resume or CV
    Add or embed your Resume or CV. Embedding a PDF allows you to preserve formatting choices and is readily viewable. Having a viewer download that content will dissuade many from reading it.

Explanation of Your Chosen Course of Study at ODU
    An outside reader will have no context for the courses and projects that you have taken.  Describe your major and what drew you to it.

Reflection on Your Experiences within the Program
    Use this section to describe, reflect on, and showcase your experiences as a student and emerging professional.  Consider highlighting specific courses or experiences as individual sections or pages on your website. For each section or page, use the following prompts to guide your thoughts, but feel free to expand beyond what is included here.

    -What was the focus of this course or experience?
    -What concepts or skills did you practice within this course or experience?
    -What projects did you work on? What were the expectations?
    -What were some of the most interesting discoveries you made while participating in this course or experience? About yourself? About others?
    -What were some of your most challenging moments and what made them so?
    -What were some of your most powerful learning moments and what made them so?
    -What material did you produce during the experience that you can share here?
    -What is the most important thing you learned personally?
    -What would you do differently if you were to go through the program again?
    -Do you have any media that would illustrate the experience for unfamiliar viewers (images, videos, audio, etc). 
Project & Work Samples from your courses and experiences
    Offer examples of relevant materials from relevant activities that you participated in. You might consider hyperlinking to documents, pulling in images, or quoting from your material. Explain what the work sample is, provide context for it (how/why was it created in this way), and share how engaging in this experiential opportunity contributed to your development as a professional.

Presentations
    Share information on presentations you have given related to your work. Provide the context for the presentation. Where did it occur? When? For whom? What was the title of the presentation? Consider providing a brief abstract. If you have presentation materials (slide deck, handouts, images, videos), you might consider including some of them as well. 

Awards
    Share information on any awards you have received, especially those related to your chosen career path.

Contact
    If someone were to find your work and have questions, the Contact page is a helpful way for them to reach out to you. An easy and safe way to offer this interaction is through the use of a Contact Form generator (offered within Wix and WordPress).
