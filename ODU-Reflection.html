        <h1 class="ms-3">Studying at ODU</h1>
        <div class="container">
          <p class="text-indent">I chose to study at ODU because my research highlighted its excellence in the Computer Science Department, and its proximity to my current residence made it a convenient choice.
              My degree focuses on the core functionalities of computers, including programming, networking, and engineering. As part of the program's elective requirements, I have taken or plan to take courses in data science, game development, and web design, while also pursuing a minor in cybersecurity.
              The projects I have worked on include a team-based initiative that predicts future enrollment numbers for computer science courses.</p>
          
          <p class="text-indent">Through my studies, I discovered a passion for creating applications capable of performing diverse functions. Now, when I encounter apps, websites, or devices, I find myself thinking about how I could design and develop them on my own. 
            One of the most challenging aspects of my journey has been realizing how far ahead some of my classmates are, which can sometimes feel discouraging.
            If I could start over, I would begin creating projects earlier to enjoy the process more and avoid rushing to showcase my skills now. Starting earlier would have also allowed me to ask more questions and gain valuable insights from the teachers I had access to.</p></p>
